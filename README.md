## About my Tasks
According to me the tasks were challenging(ofcourse they are tasks ,they should be challenging!!).I know that the number of tasks I have completed is really low  but for me learning new stuffs was more important than completing those.This does not mean that I didn't try the rest!! Most important ,I learned to google my doubts.   


## Who's me?
I belong to Kerala.The real reason why chose Amrita is because this was the only option that my parents put up for me.I did my senior secondary schooling in computer science and learned Cpp from there.Other than that lockdown helped me in learning C and python.And I have been using Linux for almost 8-9 months so I have an idea on few terminal commands too.Generally Iam interested towards problem solving and came across few online platforms for those few months back.Other than problem solving my major corner of interest is Mathematics(It may sound stupid but yeah I love math!!).
