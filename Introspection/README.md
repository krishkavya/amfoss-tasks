# Introspection

## Why must we choose you?

I was compelled to take computer science in my senior secondary schooling. But later on I started to love coding .Since the club is moved on by students and since the student mentors guide us I think I will get more oppurtunities to learn and to speak among the people there.And most importantly I hope that amFOSS can make me more confident in my technical side. 

## What is your plan for next 6 months?

Well,since the clases have started my major plan is just to attend those properly. I only  have a very little knowledge coding and languages,So I want to contribute more time on online coding platforms to improve my coding skills. And now that iam trying to become a member of amFOSS and “if I do” then to do my work honestly.

## How would you contribute back to the club?

As I have already mentioned  before I will put all efforts and will surely make all the honest attempts that I can do on all work given to me.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

For me pushing the tasks done to github was more difficult that doing it.As Iam new to github it took  almost one week for me  to figure out what Iam really supposed to do in github with the tasks. In general the tasks are really challenging .
